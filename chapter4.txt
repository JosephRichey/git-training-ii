A crowd gathered in the square as the band played. Blake nervously looked at Henrietta. It had been years since he'd played the flute and the nerves were high. Henrietta's smile was all he needed to put his skills back into play and step into a lively rendition of "Baby, I love your way". As the song continued he felt his confidence soar and knew that he had the courage to leave his banker position in the city and move to the blueberry farm as a full time flutist.

Henrietta knew that her recently inherited, long-lost father's blueberry farm was now saved and her heart felt peace as she hummed along to the flute solo. The four other people that she knew in the crowd of the town she recently moved to turned in harmony and gave her a thumbs up.
